excerpt: Getting my jam on
---

Starting in about half an hour I'll be participating in Ludum Dare 40 with the theme being announced at 6PM tonight (12/1/17). I'm excited for the jam as the themes that made it to the final voting round are quite good and inspirational. Additionally this will be my first jam using [Pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php), a very cool virtual retro console that I recommend checking out. Ultimately, I'll be publishing a web version of the game in a subsequent post.

My personal stretch goal for this jam though is to make some music for the game. Getting into digital music creation has always been something I've wanted to do and having a framework to do it in will hopefully provide a nice challenge and some incentive to actual finish it.

Here we go!
