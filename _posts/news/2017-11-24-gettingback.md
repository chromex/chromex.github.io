exerpt: Going to give this another shot
---

I've been terrible about trying to document my journey. I'm going to give it another shot since I now see it as an avenue for developing my writing ability and to help sort through my own thoughts. This seems more important to me than ever as my life experiences over the last few years have resulted in mental clarity for who I am and what I am trying to do. Since I have benefitted so much from other's stories, I hope I can find a way to share these thoughts in a way that is useful for others as well.

What follows this post in the coming years is hopefully an interesting tale of self-discovery, challenges, growth, and consequences.
