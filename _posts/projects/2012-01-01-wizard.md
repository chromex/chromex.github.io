A comprehensive project to create a small vertical slice of a single-player RPG using a purpose made component-driven engine. The engine was built around deferred rendering and data-driven level specification to explore flexibility in content creation. As a part of the project I ended up building my own reflection and factory system, physics system, and modeling tool. The modeling tool was built around the same engine which minimized rework between the game and it. Development was organized with CMake which facilitated push-button ready-to-go release builds, and multi-platform development.

Below is a sequence of videos in reverse order showing the progress of development.
