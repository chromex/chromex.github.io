A web-based retro clicker game to take you back to your childhood! Lead the ‘mallow craze as it sweeps the globe and strut your business know-how in this epic (and quite short) progress quest!

#### Design

Key goals of this game were to explore what a retro “clicker” might have been like, and more importantly, trying to make a clicker without depending on giving a small spreadsheet to the user. Given that this is a minimalist clicker, a lot of effort was spent on trying to make sure every element, both gameplay and visual, is fun and conveys meaningful gameplay information. From little details like the crying robots to the news header, I feel like the effort really brought the experience together even when the clicker-style pacing didn’t get polished to the level I wanted.
