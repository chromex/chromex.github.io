The Goo Gun was created for my final math project. The "gun" shoots out goo balls that interact with each other through springs and use verlet for numeric integration. Simulating such a scene was a problem of scale, especially since it was implemented entirely CPU side. The properties of the goo balls are highly configurable: attach distance, attachment break point, spring strength, goo weight, minimum constraint distance, etc., could all greatly change the properties of the mass. The goo mass is rendered in the scene using marching cubes against a voxel representation of the mass.
