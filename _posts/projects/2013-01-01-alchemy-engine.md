title: "Alchemy Engine"
excerpt: "An attempt to build a toolkit that will allow anyone to create their own custom co-op RPG, be it campaign oriented or re-iterative like an MMO. Focusing on the concept of small multi-player fantasy worlds like those found in MUDs, the goal of the engine is to allow anyone to build such a game and operate a server where others can play."
