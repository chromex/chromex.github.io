        <b>HIGH LOW JACK PRVIACY POLICY</b>

        Last updated 10/12/2020
        
        The High Low Jack mobile client and website strive to minimize private data gathering, distribution, and retention. This policy explains how the developer Loren Hoffman (“we”) collects, uses, and safeguards your information when accessing High Low Jack through the website or mobile client. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of the privacy policy, please do not access High Low Jack.
        
        We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason.  We will alert you about any changes by updating the “Last updated” date of this Privacy Policy.  You are encouraged to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed of updates. You will be deemed to have been made aware of, will be subject to, and will be deemed to have accepted the changes in any revised Privacy Policy by your continued use of the Application after the date such revised Privacy Policy is posted.
        
        This Privacy Policy does not apply to the third-party online/mobile store from which you install the Application or make payments, including any in-game virtual items, which may also collect and use data about you.  We are not responsible for any of the data collected by any such third party.
        
        YOUR INFORMATION
        
        High Low Jack tracks two key pieces of information: the user provided name (“username”), and a client generated identifier (“client id”). Both pieces of information are only used in the process of providing the High Low Jack service and experience, and neither are sold or shared with third parties.
        
        The client id is used by the client when communicating with the service to uniquely identify the client across play sessions for the purpose of enabling a user to re-connect to a session. The client id is not communicated to other users and is only known by the originating client and the server. The user can reset their client id if they wish. If the user plays on mobile, reinstalling the game client will generate a new client id. If the user plays on the website, deleting the browser data for the site will generate a new client id. 
        
        The username that the user types in prior to joining or creating a game is known by the originating client, the server, and the other clients that join the same High Low Jack match. The username is not stored on the server with the client id, rather it is associated with the client on a per-match basis. The other clients only retain the username for the duration of the shared match and do not store it. Changing the username between matches will not change the previously provided username from a previous match.
        
        The server stores both pieces of information in log files. These log files are used for diagnostic purposes and for generating statistics about the use of High Low Jack. For diagnostic investigation, the client id and username are used for identifying and following issues. For statistics, the client id is used to approximate the number of unique clients using the game. Log files are currently stored indefinitely.
