    <p><b>HIGH LOW JACK PRVIACY POLICY</b>

    <p>Last updated 10/13/2020</p>

    <p>The High Low Jack mobile client and website strive to minimize private data gathering, distribution, and
        retention. This policy explains how the developer Loren Hoffman (“we”) collects, uses, and safeguards your
        information when accessing High Low Jack through the website or mobile client. Please read this Privacy Policy
        carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of the privacy policy, please do not access High Low Jack.</p>

    <p>We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason. We will alert you
        about any changes by updating the “Last updated” date of this Privacy Policy. You are encouraged to periodically
        review this Privacy Policy to stay informed of updates. You will be deemed to have been made aware of, will be
        subject to, and will be deemed to have accepted the changes in any revised Privacy Policy by your continued use
        of the Application after the date such revised Privacy Policy is posted.</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to the third-party online/mobile store from which you install the Application
        or make payments, including any in-game virtual items, which may also collect and use data about you. We are not
        responsible for any of the data collected by any such third party.</p>

    <p>YOUR INFORMATION</p>
    <p>High Low Jack tracks three key pieces of identifying information: the user provided display name (“username”), a server assigned
        client id ("client id"), and a client generated unique identifier (“client guid”). All pieces of information
        are only used in the process of providing the High Low Jack service and experience, and none are sold or
        shared with third parties.</p>

    <p>The client id and client guid are used by the client when communicating with the service to uniquely identify the client across
        play sessions for the purpose of enabling a user to (re-)connect to a session. The client id and client guid are not communicated
        to other users and are only known by the originating client and the server. The user can reset their client id and client guid if
        they wish. If the user plays on mobile, reinstalling the game client will generate a new client guid. If the user
        plays on the website, deleting the browser data for the site will generate a new client guid. By reseting the client guid, the server
        will assign a new unique client id the next time the user connects to the server.</p>

    <p>The username that the user types in prior to joining or creating a game is known by the originating client, the
        server, and the other clients that join the same High Low Jack match. The username is associated with the client on a per-match basis. The other clients only retain
        the username for the duration of the shared match and do not store it. Changing the username between matches
        will not change the previously provided username as applied to a previous match.</p>

    <p>The server stores both pieces of information in log files. These log files are used for diagnostic purposes and
        for generating statistics about the use of High Low Jack. For diagnostic investigation the client id, client guid, and
        username are used for identifying and investigating issues. For statistics, the client guid is used to approximate the
        number of unique clients using the game. Log files are currently stored indefinitely.</p>
